# Hardware Requirements

This is a draft version.

## Overview

This page describes sample requirements for hardware specification.

NOTE: This type of hardware requirement should be differed depending on a target vehicle and changed by the industrial standard. It also needs to be determined during hardware design so might should be a part of the reference implementation.
