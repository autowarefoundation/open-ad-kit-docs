# Operation mode: Automatic/Manual

The in-car operator manually launches the autonomous driving system, which causes the system to start the autonomous driving.

If the fail safe system in the vehicle detects malfunctions or the in-car operator presses the button on the fail safe system, the system automatically changes the operation mode from automatic to manual. Then the vehicle automatically stops.
