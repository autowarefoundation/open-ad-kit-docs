# Design docs of Autoware

In this section, we'll explain a couple of design documents of Autoware.

The first one is about `Autoware API`.  
It defines two kinds of APIs for different developers.

1. `Autoware AD API` for developers of external systems such as fleet management HMI, etc.
   - AD means Autonomous Driving.
2. `Autoware Component Interface` for developers of Autoware components such as Localization, Perception, etc.

The second one is about the architecture of Autoware components.  
It explains the interface between Autoware components in detail.

The last one is about the repository configuration of Autoware, which is currently used [here](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware).  
It explains why such a distributed structure is necessary.
