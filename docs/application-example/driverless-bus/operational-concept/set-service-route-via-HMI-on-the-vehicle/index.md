# Set service route via HMI on the vehicle

The operator can set authorized service routes of the system via the Human Machine Interface (HMI) on the vehicle before the operation.

The system can only accept a modified route while the vehicle is parked.

NOTE: the service route cannot be changed without the authorization from the local government.
