## Open AD Kit: Containerized Workloads for the Autoware

 [The Open AD Kit](https://autoware.org/open-ad-kit/) is a collaborative project developed by [the Autoware Foundation](https://autoware.org/) and its member companies and alliance partners. It aims to bring software-defined best practices to the Autoware project and to enhance the Autoware ecosystem and capabilities by partnering with other organizations that share the goal of creating software-defined vehicles.

 Open AD Kit aims to democratize autonomous drive (AD) systems by bringing the cloud and edge closer together. In doing so, Open AD Kit will lower the threshold for developing and deploying the Autoware software stack by providing an efficient and modernized CI-CD approach.
